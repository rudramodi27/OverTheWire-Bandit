# 🎯 Bandit Level 03 → Level 04

**⚠️ SPOILER ALERT**  
This file contains the full solution for moving from Bandit level 3 to level 4. If you want to solve it yourself, stop reading now.

---

## 🎯 Level Goal
The password for the next level is located somewhere inside a directory called `inhere` in the home directory.

---

## 💡 Quick Tip
- Use `ls -la` and `file` to inspect files and discover which file is likely to contain readable text.  
- `find` is your friend when many files/subdirectories exist — filter by type/size to speed things up.  
- Never publish real passwords — use `<REDACTED>` in public repos.

---

## 📝 Commands Used
```bash
ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org s password: Use the password you obtained from level 3 (store it only locally; do not push to remote).
ls
cd inhere
ls -a
file ./*
cat ./-file07

# The output of the above command is the password for level 4.
```
