# 🎯 Bandit Level 05 → Level 06

**⚠️ SPOILER ALERT**  
This file contains the full solution for moving from Bandit level 5 to level 6. If you want to solve it yourself, stop reading now.

---

## 🎯 Level Goal
Locate and read the file that contains the password for the next level (it may be inside a directory or in an unusually-named file). 

---

## 💡 Quick Tips
- When directories contain many files, use `find` + `file` to quickly locate plain-text candidates.  
- Use `strings` on binary/data files that might hide readable text.  
- Use `ls -lb` to reveal weird/hidden characters in filenames.  
- **Do NOT** publish real passwords — replace them with `<REDACTED>` in public repos.

## 📝 Commands Used (examples)
```bash
ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org s password: Use the password you obtained from level 5 (store it only locally; do not push to remote).
ls
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2> dev/null/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

# The output of the above command is the password for level 6.
```
