# 🎯 Bandit Level 02 → Level 03

**⚠️ SPOILER ALERT**  
This file contains the full solution for moving from Bandit level 2 to level 3. If you want to solve it yourself, stop reading now.

---

## 🎯 Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `spaces in this filename` located in the home directory.

---

## 💡 Quick Tip
- Filenames can contain spaces. Use quotes (`"..."` or `'...'`) or escape spaces with backslashes (`\ `) when referring to such files.
- Don't publish real passwords — use `<REDACTED>` in public repos.

---

## 📝 Commands Used
```bash
ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org s password: Use the password you obtained from level 2 (store it only locally; do not push to remote).
ls
cd inhere
ls -a
cat ./...Hiding-From-You

# The output of the above command is the password for level 3.
```
