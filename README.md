# OverTheWire-Bandit
This repository contains a walkthrough guide to completing the Bandit levels in the OverTheWire wargames.

This repository serves as:

Documentation of my methods and thought process as I solve each level.
Revision guide based on the key takeaways from solving each challenge.
Each level of the walkthrough guide summarises the:

Level Goal (taken verbatim from what's given on the site)
Key Takeaways
Alternatives (if any)
Common misconceptions (if any)
Tip: For those using the Windows Command Prompt to ssh into each level's server, you can right-click on the cmd after copying the password unlocked from the previous level. The right-click pastes the password which was copied. Using the normal shortcut keys to paste (CTRL + V or SHIFT + INSERT) did not work for me.
