# 🎯 Bandit Level 01 → Level 02

**⚠️ SPOILER ALERT**  
This file contains the full solution for moving from Bandit level 1 to level 2. If you want to solve it yourself, stop reading now.

---

## 🎯 Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `-` located in the home directory.

---

## 💡 Quick Tip
- If a filename looks odd (like `-`), many commands treat `-` as stdin. To refer to a filename that begins with a dash, prefix it with `./` or use `--` where supported.
- Never commit real passwords or keys to a public repo — use `<REDACTED>`.

---

## 📝 Commands Used
```bash
ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org s password: Use the password you obtained from level 1 (store it only locally; do not push to remote).
ls
cat ./--spaces\ in \ this \ filename\--

# The output of the above command is the password for level 2.
```
