# 🎯 Bandit Level 06 → Level 07

**⚠️ SPOILER ALERT**  
This file contains the full solution for moving from Bandit level 6 to level 7. If you want to solve it yourself, stop reading now.

---

## 🎯 Level Goal
The password for the next level is hidden in a file somewhere in the home directory — it may be encoded or archived (not plain text).

---

## 💡 Quick Tips
- If a file is not plain text, try `file`, `strings`, or view a hex dump (`xxd` / `hexdump`) to inspect it.  
- Common encodings/compressions used in Bandit: Base64, gzip, bzip2, tar, zip. Try decoding/unpacking systematically.  
- Use `file` first — it often tells you the format (e.g., gzip compressed data, ASCII text, POSIX tar archive).  
- **Do NOT** publish real passwords — use `<REDACTED>` in public repos.

## 📝 Commands Used (examples)
```bash
ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org s password: Use the password you obtained from level 6 (store it only locally; do not push to remote).
ls
head -n 10 data.txt
grep millionth data.txt

# The output of the above command is the password for level 7.
```
