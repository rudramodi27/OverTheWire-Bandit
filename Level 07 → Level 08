# 🎯 Bandit Level 07 → Level 08

**⚠️ SPOILER ALERT**  
This file contains the full solution for moving from Bandit level 7 to level 8. If you want to solve it yourself, stop reading now.

---

## 🎯 Level Goal
Find and read the file that contains the password for the next level. The file may have unusual permissions or be accessible only in a specific way.

---

## 💡 Quick Tips
- Check file permissions and ownership with `ls -la`. Look for files readable by your user or group.  
- Use `find` to search for files with specific permissions (`-perm`) or ownership (`-user`/`-group`).  
- If a file looks like a private key, **do not** publish it — keep it local and safe.  
- **Do NOT** publish real passwords — use `<REDACTED>` in public repos.

## 📝 Commands Used (examples)
```bash
ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org s password: Use the password you obtained from level 7 (store it only locally; do not push to remote).
ls
head -n 10 data.txt
cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u

# The output of the above command is the password for level 7.
```
